{{Title:Download slowmoVideo %s}}
{{H1:Download}}

=== Requirements ===
The Optical Flow library used by slowmoVideo ([http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/chzach/opensource.html GPU-KLT+FLOW] requires an ''nVidia card''. I cannot change this, sorry. If time allows I will add other libraries in future, but don't count on this.

Currently slowmoVideo runs on ''Linux only''. OSX and Windows ports are planned for after August. I'm thinking about accepting donations for these ports since I personally do not need them.

Soon to come.
