{{H1:Download}}


=== Requirements ===
<em class="update">Update:</em> slowmoVideo now has a CPU version of the flow builder, therefore <em class="update">nVidia cards are not mandatory anymore!</em> The CPU version is based on OpenCV. The GPU version (nVidia only) uses GPU-KLT+FLOW (V3D) and is slightly more accurate.

Currently slowmoVideo runs on ''Linux only''. OSX and Windows ports should be possible now with the CPU based Optical Flow version. If you feel like giving it a try, please let me know so that changes can be integrated back into the git repository.


=== Download ===
The most recent source tarballs and Ubuntu packages are listed [[builds.php here]]. 

The read-only git repository is: $$git://granjow.net/slowmoVideo.git$$


=== Compiling ===
First you may have to resolve some dependencies. CMake will most likely inform you about missing packages as well, just in case some are missing here.
* slowmoVideo requires ffmpeg with the avformat/avcodec/swscale libraries and the Qt4 libraries
* The V3D (GPU-KLT+FLOW) library requires the [http://developer.nvidia.com/cg-toolkit-download Nvidia Cg toolkit].
* Additionally for compiling you need (at least on debian-based systems) cmake, g++, and git.




==== Installing the required packages ====
Some distribution specific installation instructions (without the Cg toolkit):

{{:tplSec.txt|
==== Debian/Ubuntu ====
$$
apt-get install build-essential cmake git ffmpeg libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libswscale-dev libqt4-dev freeglut3-dev libglew1.5-dev libsdl1.2-dev libjpeg-dev libopencv-video-dev
$$
And on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS you can directly install Cg:
$$
apt-get install nvidia-cg-toolkit
$$
}}

{{:tplSec.txt|
==== Fedora ====
For ffmpeg you may need to add the rpmfusion repository first, as explained [http://rpmfusion.org/Configuration/ here].

$$
yum install cmake ffmpeg ffmpeg-devel git qt4-devel gcc-c++ glew-devel glut-devel SDL-devel libpng-devel libjpeg-devel opencv-devel
$$
}}

{{:tplSec.txt|
==== openSUSE ====
As with Fedora an additional repository is required for ffmpeg, [http://en.opensuse.org/Additional_package_repositories#Packman Packman].

$$
zypper in cmake ffmpeg libffmpeg-devel git libqt4-devel gcc-c++ glew-devel freeglut-devel libSDL-devel opencv-devel
$$

==== … and compiling slowmoVideo ====

First slomoVideo needs to be compiled. Note that currently the $$make install$$ only installs slowmoVideo to the project directory $$/install$$ and not to your root.
$$((title=slowmoVideo compiling))
$ cd slowmoVideo # This is not the project’s root directory but a subdirectory!
$ mkdir build 
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j3
$ make install
$$
Then compile V3D which works pretty much the same way: (Only if you have an nVidia card)
$$((title=V3D compiling))
$ cd V3D
$ mkdir build 
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j3
$ make install
$$

If all of this worked, you should be able to run $$install/bin/slowmoUI$$. If not, you can drop me a message on [https://plus.google.com/108007897734481705775 Google+].
