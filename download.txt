{{Title:Download slowmoVideo %s}}
{{H1:Download}}

The most recent Ubuntu packages, Windows executables, and source tarballs are listed [[builds.php here]]. 

The read-only git repository is: $$git://granjow.net/slowmoVideo.git$$


=== Requirements ===
slowmoVideo runs on Linux and on Windows. It comes with two algorithms for calculating the Optical Flow, a CPU based one from OpenCV and a GPU based one from GPU-KLT+FLOW. Latter only runs on an nVidia card, the OpenCV algorithm runs everywhere.

slowmoVideo is not yet available on OS X since the author does not have a Mac. It should compile easily however. [[contribute.html Help is appreciated]] :)


== Compiling ==
''The following instructions are only important for you if you want to develop slowmoVideo or if there is no package for your distribution.''

First you may have to resolve some dependencies. CMake will most likely inform you about missing packages as well, just in case some are missing here.
* slowmoVideo requires ffmpeg or libav, the Qt4 libraries, and OpenCV.
* If you want to use the V3D algorithm running on nVidia cards you have to install their [http://developer.nvidia.com/cg-toolkit-download Cg toolkit] (available in most repositories as well).
* Additionally for compiling you need cmake, g++, and git.




==== Installing the required packages ====
Some distribution specific installation instructions (without the Cg toolkit):

{{:tplSec.txt|
==== Debian/Ubuntu ====
$$
apt-get install build-essential cmake git ffmpeg libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libswscale-dev libqt4-dev freeglut3-dev libglew1.5-dev libsdl1.2-dev libjpeg-dev libopencv-video-dev
$$
And on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS you can directly install Cg:
$$
apt-get install nvidia-cg-toolkit
$$
}}

{{:tplSec.txt|
==== Fedora ====
For ffmpeg you may need to add the rpmfusion repository first, as explained [http://rpmfusion.org/Configuration/ here].

$$
yum install cmake ffmpeg ffmpeg-devel git qt4-devel gcc-c++ glew-devel glut-devel SDL-devel libpng-devel libjpeg-devel opencv-devel
$$
}}

{{:tplSec.txt|
==== openSUSE ====
As with Fedora an additional repository is required for ffmpeg, [http://en.opensuse.org/Additional_package_repositories#Packman Packman].

$$
zypper in cmake ffmpeg libffmpeg-devel git libqt4-devel gcc-c++ glew-devel freeglut-devel libSDL-devel opencv-devel
$$
}}


==== … and compiling slowmoVideo ====

First slomoVideo needs to be compiled. Note that currently the $$make install$$ only installs slowmoVideo to the project directory $$/install$$ and not to your root.
$$((title=slowmoVideo compiling))
$ cd slowmoVideo # This is not the project’s root directory but a subdirectory!
$ mkdir build 
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j3
$ make install
$$
Then compile V3D which works pretty much the same way: (Only if you have an nVidia card)
$$((title=V3D compiling))
$ cd V3D
$ mkdir build 
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j3
$ make install
$$

If all of this worked, you should be able to run $$install/bin/slowmoUI$$. If not, you can drop me a message on [https://plus.google.com/108007897734481705775 Google+].
