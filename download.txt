{{H1:Download}}

=== Requirements ===
The Optical Flow library used by slowmoVideo (GPU-KLT+FLOW requires an ''nVidia card''. I cannot change this, sorry. If time allows I will add other libraries in future, but don’t count on this. That’s not something I can do in a few minutes.

Currently slowmoVideo runs on ''Linux only''. OSX and Windows ports are planned for the time after August. I’m thinking about accepting donations for these ports since I personally do not need them.

=== Download ===
The most recent source tarballs and Ubuntu packages are listed [[builds/ here]]. 

The read-only git repository is: $$git://granjow.net/slowmoVideo.git$$

=== Compiling ===
First you may have to resolve some dependencies. CMake will most likely inform you about missing packages as well, just in case some are missing here.
* slowmoVideo requires ffmpeg ($$libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libswscale-dev$$) and the Qt4 libraries
* The V3D (GPU-KLT+FLOW) library requires $$libglut3-dev libglew1.5-dev libcv-dev libsdl1.2-dev libjpeg-dev libcvaux-dev libhighgui-dev$$ and the [http://developer.nvidia.com/cg-toolkit-download Cg toolkit]. 
* Additionally for compiling you need (at least on debian-based systems): $$git cmake libqt4-dev$$

First slomoVideo needs to be compiled. Note that currently the $$make install$$ only installs slowmoVideo to the project directory $$/install$$ and not to your root.
$$((title=slowmoVideo compiling))
$ cd slowmoVideo
$ mkdir build 
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j3
$ make install
$$
Then compile V3D which works pretty much the same way:
$$((title=V3D compiling))
$ cd V3D
$ mkdir build 
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j3
$ make install
$$

If all of this worked, you should be able to run $$install/bin/slowmoUI$$. If not, you can drop me a message on [https://plus.google.com/108007897734481705775 Google+] (send me a message if you need an invitation).
