{{H1:Welcome}}

slowmoVideo is an OpenSource program that creates slow-motion videos from your footage.

How does it work? slowmoVideo tries to find out where pixels move in the video (this information is called ''Optical Flow''), and then uses this information to calculate the additional frames.

=== Technologies ===
These parts are used by slowmoVideo:
* [http://qt.nokia.com/ Qt4] as C++ programming framework
* [http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/chzach/opensource.html GPU-KLT+FLOW] for calculating the optical flow
* [http://ffmpeg.org/ ffmpeg] for reading and writing video files
