===== How can I get rid of that GPU TV-L1 window? =====
You cannot. This is the optical flow generator, which uses GLUT, which requires a window, which is shown each time optical flow has to be calculated.

To kind of get rid of it in KDE4 you can add a window rule (in $$systemsettings$$, menu point ''window behaviour'') to always open it on e.g. desktop 4 so you can work on the other desktops without constantly losing keyboard focus. Set the window title to exactly match $$GPU TV-L1 Optic Flow$$, and let the window be put on desktop 4 on initialization in the ''Geometry'' tab.

On Gnome chose «always on top» for the window you currently work in.

If you have a hint on how to do this on other desktops, please drop me an e-mail.


===== Sometimes my mouse freezes. Why? =====
This is when your GPU is doing heavy work and does not have time for updating the screen. Nothing dangerous.

===== What are those QColor::fromRgbF error message? =====
If your debug output is flooded with messages saying $$QColor::fromRgbF: RGB parameters out of range$$ then this is a result of tiniest floating point inaccuracy resulting in:
$$
x + (1.0-x) > 1.0
$$
These can be safely ignored.
